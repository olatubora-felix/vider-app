          '<div class="h3"> </div>\n<div class="h2"><strong>Our Company</strong></div>\n<p>86 Repairs is transforming a huge, overlooked problem in restaurants: getting things fixed. While other parts of the industry have evolved thanks to technology (think: online ordering, point-of-sale), repairs and maintenance (R&amp;M) has kept the status quo…</p>\n<p>Until we came along.</p>\n<p>86 launched an R&amp;M management platform built for the restaurant industry in 2018. Our tech-enabled solution includes on-demand repair management and preventative maintenance. With 86 Repairs, restaurants can access data-driven insights and 24/7 support to control their facilities, reduce their R&amp;M costs, and spend less of their team\'s time on equipment repairs.</p>\n<div class="h3"> </div>\n<div class="h2"><strong>Our Community</strong></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>86ers are thoughtful, ambitious, and creative folks working together across 20+ states and several time zones. We have industry veterans and non-industry folks alike. We believe the strength of our team can’t be contained by the four walls of an office, so we’re fully remote. We gather regularly for team events that include delicious meals at our customers’ restaurants.</p>\n<p>We\'re looking for sharp people who want to contribute new perspectives to our community and help us grow. We value folks who are comfortable with rapid change and are excited to build a company together.
